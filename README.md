#Contribute to an open source project
##Justification
###Why this project?
I contributed to an open source project known as exercism.  Exercism acknowledges that programming only comes with practice. I am a strong believer of this statement. I used to think that programming came naturally to some, and others would not be able to get it even with practice. However, my mindset changed when I started doing more problems and started to understand the concepts behind the code. Therefore, I decided to contribute to one of the Java exercises. 
###How active are the contributors on the project?
The contributors are very active on this project. I focused on the Java portion in this open source project, even in this portion of the project, there have been 1,512 commits and 112 contributors. The last commit was made in November 19, 2017. According to the website, there seems to be commits verified almost every day. Therefore, this seems to be a very popular/active open source project. 
What do you think you can contribute?
I looked through their Java exercises, and I thought I could add to some of the exercises. I have done many problems in Java in the past two years. Therefore, I have exposure to different types of questions. 
###What were your steps in choosing this project?
It was really difficult for me to pick a project. There seems to be a million open source projects, however I did not feel comfortable contributing to most because I was not sure about the language or the specifications. I went through some projects for HTML templates, beginner CSS templates, and even resume builders. I went back to the drawing board, and wrote out the skills that I currently had. I decided I was most comfortable with Java. Therefore, I tried to find a project that would offer exercises for beginner programmers. Exercism does exactly this. It provides problems in many languages for people who are interested in learning code. This is not limited to beginners, but also has exercises for more intermediate and advanced coders. 
##Documentation
In the email, because I had a very detailed explanation of my process. 
##Process
###How closely do you follow the steps and considerations described in How to choose (and contribute to) your first open source project
I followed the suggestions made  in the How to choose (and contribute to) your first open source project article written by Katrina Owen. I also read through and followed the mastering markdown site. Finally, I watched the “Your First GitHub Pull Request (in 10 Mins)” video by Jackson Bates and followed his instructions. 
##Code change:
###How did you improve the project with your code changes?
I believe I improved the project with my contribution because it will help to challenge the user to use more of the challenging statements in Java. Initially, the user just had to return the string “Hello, World!” Now, they will have to get the user input, as well as understand how to use/construct if/else/else if statements as well as for loops. 
###What kind of improvements should the end user or the developers experience?
The end user should be able to get a deeper understanding about some basic Java statements through my contributions. The mission of the open source project exercism is to help provide exercises to help the end user grow as a coder. Therefore, I believe my contribution will be able to challenge the thought process of beginner coders in Java. 
###Show the code changes and tell how it is an improvement.
 I have a more detailed picture on the email. 
 
This is the Bonus/Challenge that I added to the initial problem. I added this to the README.md file by using MARKDOWN. I used a <h1> tag (#) to format the Bonus/Challenge. I then used an ordered list (1.) to organize the requirements for this exercise. This is an improvement because it adds more scope to the problem, making it a bit more involved. Programmers who are just beginning will have to think about how these statements work, and therefore it will deepen their understanding on some of the basic statements in Java.
